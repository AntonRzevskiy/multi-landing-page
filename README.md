This is a plugin that implements the basic functionality of processing GET requests under the control of cms WordPress.

### What are tracks?
The track is special parameters in the address of the page, which are usually transmitted from your advertisements ([learn more](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033863)). To process these parameters on your site, you can use this plugin. By defaults two types of tracks are available for use in WP: _taxonomy_ and _metafield_.

### TRACK::is_strict()
The track must be indicated in the URL or the post must not be tied to the track (_only for META_).
